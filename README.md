# small-world
Visualisation to show how travel technology makes the world seem smaller because we can span distances faster.


> Although walking speeds can vary greatly depending on many factors such as height, weight, age, terrain, surface, load, culture, effort, and fitness, the average human walking speed at crosswalks is about 5.0 kilometres per hour (km/h), or about 1.4 meters per second (m/s), or about 3.1 miles per hour (mph). - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking#:~:text=Although%20walking%20speeds%20can%20vary,miles%20per%20hour%20(mph).)

## How big would the world be if, we travled the same distance walking as we do in different modes of transport in the same time.
